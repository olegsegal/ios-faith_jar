# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Oleg
**Date:** 2026-02-27

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Digital Faith Jar - an iOS app that replicates the physical "Faith Jar" experience. A Christian user selects one of 6 emotions (e.g., anxiety, sadness, joy), and the app presents a random Bible verse matching that emotion — mimicking the experience of drawing a color-coded paper slip from a physical jar.

**Goals:**
- Validate demand for a digital version of the physical Faith Jar product (popular in Philippines, growing internationally)
- Define MVP feature set for quick market testing
- Explore monetization strategies
- Design for future feature extensibility

### Session Setup

- **Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
- **Context:** Product already exists as a physical product with proven appeal. Digital version aims to test if the experience translates to mobile. User wants to move fast with minimal viable scope.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Digital Faith Jar MVP with focus on demand validation, monetization, and minimal feature set

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **SCAMPER Method (Structured):** Systematic adaptation of physical product to digital — 7 lenses for transforming the jar experience into an app
- **Role Playing (Collaborative):** Explore through multiple stakeholder perspectives — anxious user, joyful believer, pastor, skeptic, international vs Filipino user
- **Resource Constraints (Structured):** Impose extreme MVP limitations to force prioritization of essential features for hypothesis testing

**AI Rationale:** Physical-to-digital adaptation benefits from systematic exploration (SCAMPER), user empathy validation (Role Playing), and ruthless prioritization (Resource Constraints). This sequence moves from divergent exploration → user validation → convergent prioritization.

**Note:** Session was intentionally shortened — user chose to skip Role Playing and Resource Constraints techniques to move faster toward design phase. SCAMPER was partially completed (Substitute and Combine lenses) which proved sufficient for MVP scoping.

## Technique Execution Results

**SCAMPER Method (Partial — S and C lenses):**

**S — Substitute (What to replace in the digital version):**

**[Substitute #1]**: Minimalist MVP Flow
_Concept_: Select emotion → receive Bible verse relevant to that emotion → option to request another. No complex animations, focus on core value — a relevant verse for your current feeling.
_Novelty_: Conscious rejection of physical experience imitation in favor of validation speed.

**[Substitute #2]**: "Another Verse" Button
_Concept_: In the physical jar you pull one slip. In digital, we give the choice — "this one didn't resonate, give me another." This is something the physical jar CANNOT do as easily.
_Novelty_: Digital surpasses physical product — user seeks the verse that truly speaks to their heart.

**[Substitute #3]**: Support, Not Divine Lottery
_Concept_: Core value is not mystical random selection, but practical spiritual support. User seeks comfort/inspiration in the Bible matched to their emotion. Multiple verses are a feature, not a bug.
_Novelty_: Reframing the product essence: from "lottery" to "spiritual companion."

**[Substitute #4]**: Verse as Prayer Topic
_Concept_: The verse is not the endpoint, but the starting point. A user feeling joy receives a verse and uses it as the foundation for a prayer of gratitude. The app becomes a bridge between emotion and prayer.
_Novelty_: Physical jar is "read and put away." Digital version can become a tool for deeper spiritual practice.

**C — Combine (What to add to the base experience):**

**[Combine #5]**: Prayer Template with Verse
_Concept_: Each verse comes with a short prayer the user can read. "Here's the verse → here's how to pray on this topic." Lowers the barrier for those who don't know how to start praying.
_Novelty_: Physical jar gives only text. Digital version guides the user further — from reading to action.

**[Combine #6]**: Save to Favorites
_Concept_: User can save a verse that especially resonated. Over time, a personal collection builds — "my verses." Can return to them in the future.
_Novelty_: Physical slips get lost or forgotten. Digital creates a personal library of spiritual support.

**[Combine #7]**: Share Verse to Social Media
_Concept_: Beautifully formatted verse card for Instagram/WhatsApp/Telegram. User shares the word that helped them.
_Novelty_: Viral growth + evangelism simultaneously. Every share = free app advertising.

**[Combine #8]**: AI Interpretation — 3 Depth Levels
_Concept_: Revolutionary three-level system:
- **Level 1** — The verse itself (basic, like physical jar)
- **Level 2** — AI explains how this verse relates to the selected emotion (anxiety, loneliness, etc.)
- **Level 3** — User describes their specific situation, and AI provides a personal "sermon" — how this verse applies to their exact problem
_Novelty_: Essentially a **personal AI pastor**. This is something neither a physical jar nor a simple verse app can offer. Potentially the main market differentiator.

## Idea Organization and Prioritization

### Theme 1: Core Experience
- **#1** Minimalist MVP flow (emotion → verse → done)
- **#2** "Another verse" button (digital advantage)
- **#3** Support-focused, not divine lottery (core value definition)

### Theme 2: Deepening the Experience
- **#4** Verse as prayer topic (two use cases: comfort vs. gratitude)
- **#5** Prayer template per verse
- **#8** AI interpretation (3 levels — personal AI pastor)

### Theme 3: Growth and Retention
- **#6** Favorites (personal verse library)
- **#7** Social media sharing (viral growth channel)

### Prioritization Results

**MVP (Must Have):**
| Idea | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Select emotion (6 emotions) | Product core |
| Random Bible verse relevant to the selected emotion (from pre-built database mapping emotions to verses) | Product core |
| "Another verse" button | Simple feature, high value, digital advantage |

**MVP+ (Strong enhancers, add after launch):**
| Idea | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Prayer template per verse | Unique differentiator, content can be pre-built |
| Share verse to social media | Free growth channel |
| Save to favorites | User retention |

**V2 (Potential killer feature):**
| Idea | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| AI interpretation (3 depth levels) | Main differentiator + monetization model, requires AI API integration |

### Key Data Requirement
A pre-built database mapping each of the 6 emotions to a curated set of relevant Bible verses is required before launch. Approach TBD during architecture phase.

## Session Summary and Insights

**Key Achievements:**
- Defined clear MVP scope in under 30 minutes — user can proceed to design today
- Identified core value proposition: spiritual support tool, not divine lottery
- Discovered two distinct user scenarios: negative emotions (seek comfort) vs. positive emotions (seek gratitude/prayer topic)
- Uncovered potential V2 killer feature (AI interpretation) with natural monetization structure (free: Level 1, premium: Levels 2-3)
- Identified critical data requirement: emotion-to-verse database

**Session Reflections:**
User demonstrated strong product instinct — consistently prioritized speed-to-market over feature richness. The decision to cut the brainstorming session short in favor of moving to design reflects a healthy MVP mindset focused on hypothesis validation rather than feature completeness.
