# Product Brief: Faith Jar

## Executive Summary

Faith Jar is an iOS app that digitizes the popular physical "Faith Jar" experience — a jar filled with color-coded Bible verse slips matched to emotions. Users select one of 6 emotions (e.g., anxiety, sadness, joy, loneliness) and receive a relevant Bible verse, providing instant spiritual support and comfort.

The app targets the US market, capitalizing on a growing trend (Google Trends upward for "Faith Jar") and a gap left by two recently launched competitors that are either overloaded with features or overpriced. Faith Jar's competitive advantage lies in simplicity, beautiful design, and a clear path to a killer differentiator: AI-powered personal verse interpretation.

This is an MVP-first experiment to validate market demand and test monetization before investing in advanced features.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Christians seeking emotional and spiritual support through Bible verses currently rely on physical faith jars (limited, impractical for on-the-go use), searching for specific pastor videos on social media, or simply googling — none of which provide an immediate, emotion-matched, curated experience. The physical jar gives you one random slip; there's no way to easily find a verse that truly speaks to your specific situation.

### Problem Impact

- Users experiencing anxiety, sadness, or other difficult emotions lack instant access to relevant spiritual comfort
- Physical jars are static — you get one slip and can't easily draw another or search by need
- Current digital alternatives are either cluttered and cheap-looking ("God is Above" app) or prohibitively priced ($6.99 upfront for the Mexican competitor)
- Users resort to fragmented workarounds: googling verses, searching pastor video captions for specific topics

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Competitor | Core Offering | Weakness |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Physical Faith Jar** | Color-coded Bible verse slips in a jar | Not portable, limited to pre-loaded slips, can't draw another easily, slips get lost |
| **"God is Above" app** | Digital jar from physical jar creators | Overloaded with features, built-in shop, cluttered UI, looks cheap — tries to do too much |
| **Pocket Promises** ($6.99) | Indicate feeling → receive KJV Bible verse → reflect. 8 categories (Peace, Joy, Love, Hope, Strength, Comfort, Gratitude, Courage). Profile with stats (Verses Read, Saved Favorites, Day Streak) | $6.99 paywall to download. No explanation of verses, no practical advice. Verses not personalized to user's specific situation. No onboarding/profile questions. Simple but outdated/low-quality UI. |
| **Googling / YouTube** | Manual search for relevant content | Fragmented, not curated, no emotion-matching, requires effort |

### Proposed Solution

A minimalist, beautifully designed iOS app with a focused core flow:

1. **Select an emotion** (6 predefined emotions)
2. **Receive a Bible verse** matched to that emotion from a curated database
3. **"Another verse" button** — digital advantage over physical jar; keep drawing until a verse resonates

The app prioritizes simplicity and speed-to-value. No shop, no clutter, no bloat — just the core spiritual support experience done right.

### Key Differentiators

- **Simplicity over feature bloat** — Intentionally minimal where competitors are cluttered
- **Beautiful, modern design** — Premium feel vs. cheap-looking competitors
- **"Another verse" capability** — Digital surpasses physical; find the verse that truly speaks to you
- **US market focus** — Targeting highest-value market while trend is growing
- **Clear monetization path** — Free core experience with premium AI interpretation (V2)
- **AI personal pastor potential (V2)** — Three-level verse interpretation system that no competitor offers: verse → emotion-matched explanation → personalized "sermon" for user's specific situation
- **First-mover timing** — Competitors just launched (Sept/Dec 2025), market is nascent and growing

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**Persona 1: Maria, 28 — The Anxious Believer (US)**

- **Background**: Young professional Christian woman living in the US. Attends church regularly but often feels overwhelmed by daily stress — work pressure, relationships, uncertainty about the future.
- **Current behavior**: When anxious, she googles "Bible verses for anxiety" or scrolls through Instagram looking for pastor posts with relevant captions. Sometimes uses a physical faith jar at home but can't carry it everywhere.
- **Pain point**: Needs immediate spiritual comfort in the moment — on the bus, during a work break, at 2 AM when she can't sleep. Current solutions require too much effort or aren't available on the go.
- **Success looks like**: Opens the app, taps "Anxious," reads a verse that speaks to her heart, feels a moment of peace. Takes less than 30 seconds from need to comfort.
- **Emotional driver**: Seeking reassurance that God sees her and cares about her specific struggle.

**Persona 2: Grace, 35 — The Grateful Worshiper (Filipino-American)**

- **Background**: Filipino-American mother of two, deeply devout. Already familiar with the physical Faith Jar concept from her community in the Philippines. Uses faith practices as a daily routine.
- **Current behavior**: Uses a physical faith jar at home. Shares Bible verses with family and church group via WhatsApp. Looks for verses to match her mood — sometimes grateful, sometimes seeking strength.
- **Pain point**: Physical jar is limited — same verses cycle through, can't share them beautifully, can't save the ones that resonated most.
- **Success looks like**: Draws a verse in the morning as part of her routine, saves the ones that speak to her, shares beautifully formatted verse cards with her prayer group.
- **Emotional driver**: Deepening daily spiritual practice and connecting with community through shared faith.

### Secondary Users

- **Pastors / group leaders**: May recommend the app to their congregation as a daily spiritual practice tool
- **Gift givers**: People who buy physical faith jars as gifts may discover the app as a digital alternative
- **Curious seekers**: Non-regular churchgoers exploring faith, looking for accessible entry points to the Bible

### User Journey

1. **Discovery**: App Store search ("faith jar app," "Bible verses for anxiety"), social media share from a friend, pastor recommendation, or transition from physical jar
2. **Onboarding**: Minimal — choose your first emotion, receive your first verse immediately. No account required for core experience.
3. **Core Usage**: Open app when feeling a specific emotion → select emotion → read verse → tap "another verse" if needed → feel supported
4. **Aha Moment**: The verse that perfectly matches their situation — "This is exactly what I needed to hear right now"
5. **Retention**: Daily habit formation — morning verse routine, returning during emotional moments, building a favorites collection (MVP+)
6. **Advocacy**: Sharing verse cards on social media, recommending to church friends (MVP+)

## Success Metrics

### User Success Metrics

- **Core value delivery**: Users find a resonating verse within 3 taps (emotion → verse → optional "another verse")
- **Return usage**: Users return to the app at least 3x per week within first month
- **Verse engagement**: Average of 1.5+ verses viewed per session (indicates "another verse" feature is used)
- **Retention**: 30-day retention rate > 20% (strong for a utility app)

### Business Objectives

- **3-month goal**: Validate demand — 1,000+ organic downloads, positive App Store reviews (4.0+ rating)
- **6-month goal**: Test monetization readiness — sufficient engaged user base to justify V2 (AI interpretation) development
- **12-month goal**: Launch premium tier (AI interpretation), achieve initial revenue

This is an experiment. The primary business objective is **learning**, not revenue:
- Is there real demand for a digital faith jar?
- Will users pay for enhanced features (AI interpretation)?
- What emotion categories and verses resonate most?

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (MVP — Launch)

| Feature | Description | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Emotion selection** | 6 emotion categories displayed on main screen | Product core — the entry point |
| **Bible verse display** | Random curated verse matching the selected emotion | Product core — the value delivery |
| **"Another verse" button** | Draw another verse for the same emotion | Key digital advantage over physical jar, simple to build |
| **Curated verse database** | Pre-built mapping of emotions → relevant Bible verses | Required data foundation — must be done before launch |

**Emotion Categories for MVP** (6): Anxiety, Sadness, Joy, Loneliness, Anger, Gratitude
*(Note: Pocket Promises uses 8 categories with different naming. Final category list to be refined during PRD.)*

### Out of Scope for MVP

| Feature | Phase | Rationale for deferral |
|---------|-------|----------------------|
| Prayer templates per verse | MVP+ | High value but content-heavy to produce |
| Save to favorites | MVP+ | User retention feature, not core value |
| Social media sharing (verse cards) | MVP+ | Growth channel, not core value |
| User stats (streak, verses read) | MVP+ | Retention mechanic, validated by Pocket Promises |
| AI verse interpretation (3 levels) | V2 | Main differentiator + monetization, requires AI API integration |
| User accounts / profiles | V2 | Not needed for core experience |
| Multiple Bible translations | V2 | KJV or NIV for MVP, expand later |
| Push notifications / daily verse | MVP+ | Engagement driver, not core value |

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful if:
1. **Users download it** — organic demand exists (500+ downloads in month 1)
2. **Users return** — the core experience provides enough value for repeat usage (7-day retention > 25%)
3. **Users rate it positively** — the experience is polished enough (4.0+ App Store rating)
4. **"Another verse" is used** — users engage beyond single verse (40%+ sessions)

**Go/No-Go for MVP+**: If 3 of 4 criteria are met within 60 days, proceed to MVP+ features.
**Go/No-Go for V2**: If MVP+ shows strong engagement and user feedback requests personalization, proceed to AI interpretation development.

### Future Vision

**MVP+ (Post-launch enhancers):**
- Prayer templates paired with each verse — bridge from reading to spiritual action
- Favorites collection — personal verse library that grows over time
- Social sharing with beautifully designed verse cards — viral growth + evangelism
- Usage stats and day streaks — habit formation and retention

**V2 (Killer feature — monetization):**
- **AI Interpretation — 3 Depth Levels:**
  - Level 1 (Free): The verse itself — same as MVP
  - Level 2 (Premium): AI explains how this verse relates to the selected emotion
  - Level 3 (Premium): User describes their specific situation → AI provides a personalized "sermon" — how this verse applies to their exact problem
- This is effectively a **personal AI pastor** — no competitor offers this
- Monetization: freemium model — free core, subscription for AI features

**V3+ (Long-term possibilities):**
- Community features — share verses and reflections within church groups
- Pastor dashboard — recommend specific verse collections to congregations
- Multi-language support — expand beyond English to Spanish, Tagalog, etc.
- Android version
- Widget for home screen — verse of the day
